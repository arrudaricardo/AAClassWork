### Daily Projects

+ Work on the phases in order
+ Make sure you understand every single line of code
+ It is more important to understand than to race to finish

---

### Assessments

+ Academic Integrity
  + No notes
  + No copying
  + No sharing of assessments
  + No discussion with others during assessment
+ Violations will result in dismissal
+ Remote vs In-Person

### Remote Assessments

+ Two: W2D1 and W3D1 
+ Failing either assessment will result in _deferral_ to the next cohort
+ We want to make sure you are ready before continuing to Week 3
+ You must share your screen during these assessments; not doing so will result in a fail and dismissal

---

### In-Person Assessments

+ Six
+ No consequences for failing one assessment
+ Retake if you fail a second assessment
  + One retake per person
  + The retake is given on same day
  + It is a different version of the assessment
+ Failing the retake will result in _dismissal_

---

### Assessment Advice

+ The material covered each day builds on the last
+ Assessments are necessary checkpoints
+ Everybody can score 100%
+ If you get a bug: relax, breath deep, and read the error message
+ Read the spec files

---

### Tips For Success at a/A

+ Be present & punctual
+ Complete your work to the best of your ability
+ Prioritize understanding over completion for the daily projects
+ Ask for help when you need it
+ Focus full-time on App Academy

---

### Growing As a Developer

+ Talk to one another - speak code!
